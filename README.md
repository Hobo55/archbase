  Thanks to Eric Dubois and the team at Arcolinux.

 # Note:
 
  * Update mirrors w/alias 'mirror', then update distro w/alias 'update' or 'upall'.
 
  * cd into ~/arco-xfce and run scripts to install distro.
 
  * After distro install cd into ~/arco and run start-here.sh.
 
  * start-here.sh runs menu to run scripts for programs and files.
 
  * Vim & Neovim was synced w/o plugins/folders installed as they are git repos.
	 So, plugins I use are already listed in Plug section of .vimrc/init.vim.
	 Do a :PlugInstall once files are in place ~/.vim & ~/.config/nvim.
