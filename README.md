  Thanks to Eric Dubois and the team at Arcolinux.

 # note:
 
  * After distro install cd into ~/arco and run start-here.sh.
    start-here.sh provides a menu to run scripts to install
    packages & restore files. 
  * Vim was synced w/o plugins installed as they are git repos.
	  So, plugins are already listed in Plug section of .vimrc.
	  Do a :PlugInstall once ~/.vim files are in place.
