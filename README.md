 ## archbase
  * Restore user's select configs/files after non-arcolinux arch-based installs.

 ## Arcolinux:
  * Install scripts modified from Arcolinux.
  * More info at https://arcolinux.info
  * Thanks to Eric Dubois and the team at Arcolinux.

 ### note:
  * After distro is installed cd into ~/archbase and run start-here:
       $./start-here
    - which provides a menu to install packages & restore files.
  * Vim was synced w/o plugins installed as they are git repos.
