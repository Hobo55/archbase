# -- Configure Vim for scriptwriting --

	
The vim text editor has many, many configuration settings. 
There are several common options that can facilitate script writing.

The following turns on syntax highlighting:

:syntax on

With this setting, different elements of shell syntax will be displayed 
in different colors when viewing a script. 
This is helpful for identifying certain kinds of programming errors. 

** Note that for this feature to work, you must have a complete 
version of vim installed, and the file you are editing must have a
shebang indicating the file is a shell script. If you have difficulty 
with the previous command, try :set syntax=sh instead.

The following turns on the option to highlight search results.

:set hlsearch

Say we search for the word echo. With this option on, each instance 
of the word will be highlighted.

The following sets the number of columns occupied by a tab character.:

:set tabstop=4

The default is eight columns. Setting the value to 4 (which is a 
common practice) allows long lines to fit more easily on the screen.

The following turns on the “auto indent” feature:

:set autoindent

This causes vim to indent a new line the same amount as the line 
just typed. This speeds up typing on many kinds of programming 
constructs. To stop indentation, press Ctrl-d.

These changes can be made permanent by adding these commands (without the
leading colon characters) to your ~/.vimrc file.
